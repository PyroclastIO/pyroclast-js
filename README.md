## pyroclast-js

Browser + Node.js support for sending events to a Pyroclast topic.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save pyroclast
```

## Usage

First, define a configuration.

```javascript
const pyroclast = require('pyroclast');

const client = new pyroclast.PyroclastClient({
    writeApiKey: "<your api token>",
    topicId: "<your topic ID>",
    endpoint: "<pyroclast endpoint>"
});
```

### Send one event asynchronously

```javascript
client
    .sendEvent({type: "page-visit", page: "/home", timestamp: 1495072835000})
    .then((result) => {
        // ...
    });
```

### Send a batch of events asynchronously

```javascript
client
    .sendEvents([
        {type: "page-visit", page: "/home", timestamp: 1495072835000},
        {type: "page-visit", page: "/home", timestamp: 1495072836000},
        {type: "page-visit", page: "/home", timestamp: 1495072837000}
    ])
    .then((results) => {
        // ...
    });
```

## Supplying a [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) implementation

By default:
* In the browser, the native `window.fetch` implementation is used, if available (as in modern browsers).
* In Node.js, `node-fetch` is used.

To override this behavior:
A. (Browser/Node.js) Pass the implementation as the `fetchImpl` option, or
B. (Browser only) Use a polyfill to define fetch globally.

Note that to support older browsers, you will likely also need a Promise polyfill.
